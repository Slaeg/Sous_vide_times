# Sous Vide Cooking Time Web App - A Learning Project

This application is a web-based tool for finding the optimal sous vide cooking times and temperatures for different food types. It was created as a learning project to practice working with databases, web APIs, and frontend development. The application uses a Flask backend to provide an API for accessing a SQLite database of cooking times, and a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend to provide a user interface.
Learning Objectives

## Through this project, I aimed to:

Understand how to design, create, and populate a SQLite database
Gain experience with the Flask web framework and creating APIs
Learn how to handle user input and display results in a web interface

## Usage

To query the API directly, you can send a GET request to /times with the food_type query parameter, e.g. localhost:5000/times?food_type=Apples.
To use the web interface, navigate to localhost:5000 in your web browser. Enter a food type into the form and press the 'Search' button to get the cooking time and temperature.

Remember to replace https://github.com/yourusername/sous-vide-app.git with the actual URL of your repository, and adjust any parts of the instructions if necessary for your specific project. This README should serve as a brief introduction to the project for other students, instructors, or anyone else who might be interested.
