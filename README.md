# Sous_vide_times

Sous Vide Cooking Time Web App - A Learning Project

This application is a web-based tool for finding the optimal sous vide cooking times and temperatures for different food types. It was created as a learning project to practice working with databases, web APIs, and frontend development. The application uses a Flask backend to provide an API for accessing a SQLite database of cooking times, and a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend to provide a user interface.
Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aimed to:

    Understand how to design, create, and populate a SQLite database
    Gain experience with the Flask web framework and creating APIs
    Learn how to handle user input and display results in a web interface
